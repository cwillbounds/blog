Always look on the bright side of life! *whistling*

  * **New rig** \- My windows laptop died the other year so I needed a replacement to satisfy my gaming needs. I got myself a new box with medium tier parts.
  * **Learned Django** \- Finally learned Django after years of programming in Python. My first project was [this job board](https://python.ph/jobs/).
  * **New Insync office** \- Insync moved to a house in Xavierville Ave, Loyola Heights. QC represent!
  * **Baked without mixes** \- Not by myself but helped throughout the process. And it was really good!
  * **Taught Django** \- Got to teach basic Django in one of DevCon’s [code camps](http://devcon.ph/events/python-code-camp-professionals). I presented the process of creating a [Tinder clone](https://github.com/marksteve/devcon-django-workshop) (what? it was hip then) using Django. I also mentored in the first [Django Girls Manila workshop](https://djangogirls.org/manila/).
  * **Surfed** \- Got to try out surfing in Baler. That proved useful when we went to Siargao later in the year.
  * **Attended my first non-relative wedding** \- Not really an achievement but I wanted to add it to the list. Congrats [Ton and Ana](https://tonandana.com/)!
  * **Koh Phangan** \- Let’s mix in some travel. Koh Phangan is as beautiful as it was when I first saw it a few years ago. There were a lot more commercial establishments though.
  * **Started sport climbing** \- I got better than I was back in P.E. Still not good enough to be considered “good at it”. Outdoors was really fun! A lot scarier but the view is way more gorgeous.
  * **Helped organize PyCon PH** \- It’s my third time helping out. Good people makes it easy to volunteer.
  * **New job** \- Not technically a new job but I left [Insync](https://insynchq.com) to focus on a [startup](https://blankhq.com) I’ve co-founded. It’s one of the biggest decisions I made this year.
  * **Siargao** \- Best adventure of my entire life so far. Waves, motorbikes and appreciating nature’s beauty and scale. Best birthday ever!
  * **Gave a keynote talk** \- DevCon gave me the chance to do a keynote talk at their [annual conference](http://summit.devcon.ph/). I admittedly didn’t deliver a “keynote” talk but watching the good speakers throughout the event made me want to really improve.
  * **Sydney** \- One of the most pleasant places I’ve been to and it couldn’t have been better with the good friends I was with.
