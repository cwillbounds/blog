  * Third hackathon win (Globe Devathon)

2013 has been good to me. Being more open to new things and proactive in
general has really paid off. I’m lucky to have awesome people around me so I
try to treasure them as much as I can.

Hoping to meet more amazing people, go to more breath-taking places and tackle
more interesting challenges this 2014.

Happy new year!
