I’m not good with talking… specially when I haven’t had beer yet. I avoid eye
contact. I stare at my slides. My voice breaks. When I’m tipsy I loosen up. I
can look up. But I slur like what drunk people do. I’ve done a number of talks
but I still feel uncomfortable doing it.

But I still accept when I’m invited. It’s something I want to be good at. And
to be good at something, you need practice. And beer.
